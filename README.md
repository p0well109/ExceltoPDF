Input01 sheet as Excel input to be provided by the user and read by the program as input, PO Number column is the number generated or written by the program back to Excel. 
Output01 and Output02 would be the template of the invoice written by the program and converted to PDF depending on the number of records processed from the Input01 rows.
Each Output01 sheet will produce a separate PDF document/ 1 PDF per PO depending on the Input01 rows.

Note: The processing of PO number are handled in an Apache POI Excel utility and I have done that writing of PO Number to the Excel. I just want to see how the Output## 
template sheets from Excel can be converted to PDF format. Or that 1 line from Input01 can be formatted from Excel to PDF in such Output template. 
Or that row line from Input01 can be formatted from Excel to PDF in such Output template.
